One of Alvida's pirates attempts to open the barrel, but a young boy emerges and accidentally hits him. The remaining pirates attack him, but the stranger stops them and says that his name is Monkey D. Luffy. Luffy drags Coby to the storage cellar of the ship, where he eats and converses with Coby, who reveals his dream of being a marine. Alvida confronts Luffy, but he escapes and knocks her pirate crew down with his Devil Fruit power. Luffy explains that he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, therefore he has the properties of rubber. Coby, inspired by Luffy, stands up for himself when Alvida confronts them. Luffy uses his Gum-Gum Pistol technique on Alvida. Luffy and Coby sail away in a \"borrowed\" boat from Alvida's crew. Luffy asks about the pirate hunter Coby mentioned earlier. Coby says that he was captured by the Marines, and Luffy announces his intention of asking him to join his crew."

A bandit named Higuma enters and orders several barrels of booze. Shanks offers him the last bottle but Higuma smashes it and humiliates Shanks. After the bandit leaves the bar, all of the pirates start to laugh. Luffy gets angry that Shanks did not fight back and in a huff eats a purple fruit lying on the bar. Shanks notices this and tries to make Luffy spit it out, but it was too late. Shanks tells Luffy that he just ate the Gum Gum Fruit, a Devil Fruit, and now he is a rubber man and won't be able to ever swim again. Later, Luffy gets attacked by Higuma and his bandits. He is about to be killed, when Shanks and his crew arrive and effortlessly defeat Higuma's men. Frightened, Higuma throws down a smoke bomb and makes his escape, taking Luffy with him. He flees out to sea in a boat. There he throws the non-swimmer into the water. As Higuma laughs at Luffy's plight, a Sea King appears behind him and devours him whole. The sea monster then goes for Luffy, but Shanks stops the sea monster as it takes a bite, and with one look, drives the beast away. Luffy clutches Shanks and starts crying, since Shanks' arm was bitten off by the creature. Shanks replies that it is fine, as long as Luffy is safe. As the pirates get ready to leave, Luffy decides he will become a pirate on his own, that he will gather a crew that will beat Shanks', and that he will become King of the Pirates. Shanks gives his straw hat to Luffy and tells him to return it some day, as a great pirate. Back in the present, Luffy slingshots into the sky to catch a bird. Instead he is caught himself. Zoro, now alone in their boat, tries to keep up, paddling. On his way he picks up three castaways from Buggy's crew. The bird, carrying Luffy flies over a town, where it is shot down by Buggy's men. Luffy falls down and lands right in front of Nami, who is running away from Buggy's crew for stealing their precious map to the Grand Line."

Jango hurls his chakram and cuts down many trees, searching everywhere for them, and Kaya falls down. She tells the Usopp Pirates to run before they are killed, but they stay and fight, deciding to follow their captain's orders and fight to the death for Kaya. Back at the slope, Kuro claims that he hated being a pirate. Luffy refuses to be like him and Kuro uses his Silent Step to move quickly. Luffy gets the timing right, however, and pounds Kuro down. Kuro gets back up and announces that he is going to kill his entire crew, and that it was part of his plan from the beginning. Luffy claims that Usopp could beat Kuro. Kuro laughs it off and uses Shakushi, causing him to disappear. As Luffy wonders where he went, Nami finishes up looting the Black Cat pirate ship, disappointed by the amount of treasure. She then wonders if the battle is over, but sees that Kuro slashes through several of his crewmates, taking them down quicker than the naked eye can see. Luffy gets even more angry, but just after Kuro slashes him in the chest, he grabs Kuro's arm and slams him onto the ground. Kuro stands up and says that now his crew is suffering because Luffy wouldn't let them die quickly, and so Kuro uses Shakushi once again to disappear. In the forest, at that moment, Jango continues searching for the Usopp Pirates, and they toss him a white flag. Jango walks forward and so the Usopp Pirates launch their ambush. Jango trips over a rope and one of the Usopp Pirates showers him with pepper, making him sneeze. The second jumps out and strikes Jango in the groin with a frying pan. The third leaps down from a large rock and takes a swing at Jango's head, but Jango sits up in time and knocks his attacker away. Kaya then comes out, telling Jango not to hurt the kids, but Jango reports that it was his orders from Kuro to kill the children. Kaya then grabs Jango's chakram and holds it in front of her throat, threatening to kill herself without writing the will. Jango agrees, and so he gets Kaya to write the will. Once finished, he grabs her by the neck and holds her against a tree, holding up a chakram to kill her. Zoro is still running through the woods with Usopp on his back, and Usopp spots Jango. Kuro slices up the rocks, followed by cutting up Luffy's left shoulder as he glances in anger as the episode ends."

As he is doing so, Luffy announces that he has finished the pirate flag for their ship, and holds it up. It's a terribly drawn skull and crossbones, of course. The others are horrified of the artwork, and so Usopp tells them that he is a great painter. He paints a pirate flag with his own face on it, but the others reject it so he paints a proper pirate flag, a very nice one at that. They fly it on the mast and continue to sail. As they are sailing, Nami spots an island in the distance with her telescope, saying it is Legendary Treasure Island. Usopp says how he heard that there is a valuable treasure on the island, but if one tries to claim it they will face God's wrath. As the Straw Hats draw nearer to the island, the weather turns foul and the waters very choppy. After a tough sail they make it to the island. The Straw Hats head into the jungle, looking for treasure. Zoro lies down and starts to nap, and as Usopp is shocked at how he can sleep in a creepy place like this, the Straw Hats find themselves surrounded by strange animals, creatures that are combinations of two or more animals. A voice booms through the jungle, claiming to be the Guardian God of the island and telling them to leave. Luffy picks up a lion pig that bites him on the face. The voice is shocked and Luffy explains he ate the Devil's Fruit. A gun then pokes out through a bush and shoots Luffy in the back, but Luffy bounces the bullet into the air with his Gum Gum powers. Luffy then spots a twitching green bush, and the owner of the voice takes off running. Luffy, Usopp, and Nami catch up to the man in the treasure chest, named Gaimon. Luffy explains to him how he wants to go to the Grand Line and claim One Piece, but Gaimon doesn't think he can do it. Luffy and Gaimon converse about how they can't read a map, and Nami is angered by this. Gaimon then explains how he became trapped in the treasure box as Zoro finally joins them. He explains that twenty years ago, he was with his crew in search of the treasure, and as they were leaving, he noticed how the captain never searched on top of a large cliff. Gaimon scaled the cliff but slipped and fell, getting stuck in a treasure box. He found that his crew had left, and he thought he would have the treasure on the ridge to himself, but found he could not climb in the box. When Luffy tries to pull Gaimon out of the box, he explains that his body grew to match the shape of the box, and his body will be ruined if the box is broken. Luffy then realizes that Gaimon uses the strange animals of the island to ward off visitors. Inspired by Gaimon's story, the Straw Hats decide to help Gaimon find the treasure. They come to the ridge and Luffy uses Gum Gum Rocket to launch himself up to the top, where there are five treasure chests. He refuses to hand them over to Gaimon, and while this shocks and angers Nami and Usopp, Gaimon realizes that the treasure boxes must be empty. Luffy confirms this, and so Gaimon begins to cry, saying that he's been guarding nothing for twenty years. Luffy says it could be worse, as he could have died guarding nothing, and he offers Gaimon to join their crew. Gaimon decides to stay with the strange animals of the island, however, as he has decided to protect them instead of the treasure. With this adventure behind them, the Straw Hats set sail in the Going Merry once again, waving goodbye to Gaimon as the episode draws to a close."

The lady then questions if the restaurant is in the middle of the ocean, which Fullbody answers by telling her to just look forward to it. In the meantime, on the Going Merry, Zoro recognizes the intruder who got beat up by Luffy from the last episode as Johnny. Johnny then brings the straw hat pirates' attention to Yosaku, who lies ill on his and Johnny's small ship. Turns out that Johnny, Yosaku, and Zoro used to be bounty hunter partners some time ago. Johnny then proceeds to tell the straw hat pirates that he took Yosaku to a small rock island to rest, which was coincidentally blown up by Usopp and Luffy for target practice in the last episode. Usopp and Luffy quickly apologize. Johnny, however, was more worried about Yosaku's condition, which Nami quickly diagnosed as scurvy caused by a lack of Vitamin C. Luffy and Usopp then shove a bunch of lemons into Yosaku's mouth and Yosaku is revived!... or at least for 5 minutes. The straw hat pirates conclude that they need a cook for their potential nutritional problems. Johnny points out that they probably can find a good candidate in the floating sea restaurant known as Baratie. He also states that the one Zoro has been looking for, Hawk-eyes Mihawk, is near there too. Thus they head to Baratie, which actually is pretty much right next to where they were. They are then passed by Fullbody's marine ship. Fullbody doesn't recognize the straw hat pirates mark, but he recognizes Johnny and Yosaku as worthless pirate hunters. Johnny responds by shouting \"this is what pirate hunters do\" while throwing a bunch of wanted posters in the air. Nami takes note of the Arlong poster with an angry look and crumbles the poster in her hands. Fullbody then orders his crew to sink the pirate ship. Luffy attempts to deflect the cannon but after losing his grip accidentally deflects it to the head chief's room in Baratie, where the head chief was subsequently injured and demands that Luffy work off his crime by working for the restaurant for one year. In Baratie, while attempting to impress his girlfriend, Fullbody instead becomes humiliated by Sanji's witty remarks. Turns out that Sanji is actually the Assistant Head Chef. Frustrated, Fullbody destroys his table full of food. Sanji, who is angry that Fullbody wasted precious food, beats Fullbody up."

Upon leaving the bathroom, Patty becomes furious when he sees that Sanji is beating up Fullbody, who is a customer. Sanji replies that customer or not, Fullbody insulted a chef and his food. At this moment, the head chef and Luffy come crashing down from the ceiling because the head chef was kicking Luffy too hard while trying to convince him that he has to work at Baratie for a whole year to pay off his debt. The head chef then kicks Sanji to calm him down and also kicks Fullbody out of the restaurant. Fullbody's subordinate then comes running into the restaurant yelling that their prisoner, a member of Don Krieg's pirates, has escaped. The customers are terrified because Don Krieg is supposedly the strongest pirate in East Blue. The pirate shoots the marine from behind and comes in to order food. Patty recognizes the pirate as a customer and asks if the pirate has any money on him. The pirate points a gun at Patty and says \"is a bullet okay?\" Patty then beats the pirate up and doesn't recognize the pirate as a customer since he has no money. Sanji, on the other hand, heads to the kitchen and starts making a meal. Fullbody in the meantime, leaves the restaurant sneakily (along with the subordinate who got shot earlier, guess he is still alive). Sanji brings his meal to the pirate, who was thrown out by Patty. Sanji states that, for him, a customer is anybody who is hungry. He also states that he understands the feeling of starvation more than anybody else. The pirate then grabs the meal and gobbles it up, while crying and saying that this is the most delicious dish he has ever had in his entire life. Luffy, who was watching the whole thing, attempts to recruit Sanji as the cook for his crew. After refusing and some conversing, we find out that the head chef used to be a notorious pirate and the restaurant often comes into conflict with other pirates after his fame. Luffy, as always, is stubborn and insists that Sanji joins them. We also find out that the other pirate's name is Gin. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, we learn that Don Krieg is the captain of a fleet of 50 ships. Gin thanks Sanji for the meal and leaves. Sanji throws the dishes into the ocean to get rid of the evidence that Sanji is giving out food for free, which makes Gin even more grateful. Luffy is then sent back to work, where he ends up breaking even more dishes and makes a big commotion in the kitchen. The rest of the crew, Zoro, Nami, and Usopp, turn out to be eating a meal at the restaurant. Sanji, after seeing Nami, is captivated by her beauty. While flirting with Nami, the head chef tells Sanji that he's annoying and that he doesn't need him anymore. Meanwhile, Gin informs Don Krieg of the restaurant, where Don Krieg makes clear his intention to \"visit\" the restaurant."

Unable to catch Karoo and Usopp, Mr. 5 resolves to use his newest piece of equipment, a revolver, which he loads, instead of with bullets, with his explosive breath."

Luffy, again himself, attempts to destroy the pedestal but is interrupted by the returning Mr. 3, who creates himself a waxen battle suit. Usopp is finally struck down by Mr. 5's explosive shots, but is still able to make Karoo run around the pedestal dragging behind it a rope, which Usopp soaks in flammable oil. Luffy, then, grabs Mr. 3 at his burning, three-shaped hairdo and uses it to inflame the rope, burning the large wax structure and freeing the others. As they emerge from the flames, Nami and Vivi defeat Miss Valentine and Zoro makes quick work of Mr. 5. Luffy and Karoo chase after Mr. 3 and his partner and defeat them, respectively. Meanwhile, Sanji stumbles upon Mr. 3's hideout, where he receives a call from Mr. 0."

They attack Sanji, but he defeats them. To justify the noisy interruption, Sanji tells Mr. 0 that one of the Straw Hats was still alive. Crocodile tells him to return to Alabasta, then, after the conversation, orders Mr. 2 to intercept and eliminate Mr. 3 en route for his failure to make accurate reports. While Broggy creates a rainfall of tears, Dorry wakes up and concludes that, after a hundred years, Broggy's axe had gotten dull and only knocked him out. Using the eternal pose to guide them, the crew sets sail. Dorry and Broggy see them off, and, to thank them, sacrifice their worn out weapons to kill a giant goldfish as it attempts to feed on the Straw Hats' ship. [n 12]"

Then, for no apparent reason, Luffy slingshots himself and Lapanui to another part of the mist. At the harbor, Nami ties a long lifeline, prepared by Henzo, to a boat and enters the Rainbow Mist. Once inside, Ian, who convinced one of the children to release him, steals the boat and escapes. He reaches Whetton and describes to him the mist's treasures. Whetton orders his men to invade the mist. The town's large tower falls into the water, creating a bridge from the island into the mist, and Whetton and his men cross it to attack."

There, Luffy fights Whetton and, as it becomes clear that he cannot defeat Luffy face-to-face, Whetton detonates the tower, trapping everyone else inside and Whetton's abandoned men join forces with Luffy's group. An exit appears in the distance and they row toward it, but it closes too fast for them to reach it. Hoping to generate enough wind to blow the Straw Hats' ship clear of the mist, Lapanui stays behind to destroy the navy ship's armory. The other children follow him, promising to meet Henzo again. The explosion they cause successfully blows the Straw Hats' ship outside the mist. There, a group of navy ships, led by an aged Lapanui, arrives and confiscates the Rainbow Mist's treasures from Whetton and takes him and his men into custody."

In the process, Spandam proudly reveals to Robin that he is the son of Spandaine, the previous CP9 head who was responsible for the Buster Call at Ohara. This causes Robin to be utterly livid yet powerless as stream of tears runs down her cheeks as all seems hopeless after Franky was seemingly taken out by a mine Spandam placed at the entrance to the Bridge of Hesitation. But at the last second, an explosive projectile hits the back of Spandam's head. A stream of projectiles falls on the marines gathered around him. The culprit is revealed to be Usopp, standing on top of the Tower of Law far from the marines' firing range. Robin attempts to run towards the other side the bridge before Franky saves her from being shot by the marines, freeing her from sea stone handcuffs to vent out her rage on Spandam. As Usopp leaves to regroup with the others, he hears something before an explosion occurs."

Iceberg proceeds to tell the Straw Hats that they might have to take desperate matters to force him to join their crew.

Then explaining the room Chopper, Usopp, and Nami found was his, Hogback then tells his story of how he met Cindry and fell in love with the performer. But both the revelation of Cindry having a fiancé and her accidental death on stage made negative impacts on Hogback as he is approached by Moria. Hogback agreed to join his cause on the condition that he can revive her a zombie. Hogback admits that the zombified Cindry lack her original personality, but he only desired her beauty and assumes she is happy to be alive. This infuriates Chopper as he refuses to allow Hogback to continue making everyone suffer, the scientist ordering Cindry to kill the intruders so he can use their corpses in his experiments. Though Cindry is revealed to have modified superhuman strength, is nearly exposed to salt after Chopper yells that real humans have freedom. When Hogback orders Jigoro and Inuppe to kill everyone to protect Cindry, the two zombies ended up fighting each other before Robin tricks Hogback into ordering the two to jump out the tower. With Chopper intending to beat Hogback to a bloody pulp, the scientist orders Cindry to buy time for him to escape. But everyone is surprised to see a tearful Cindry as she revealed she could not move. Elsewhere, Oars finally returns to Moria's side."

Brook then claims that the whale is Laboon but they finally see a whole bunch of whales and the others claim that Laboon is not here but in the first half of the grand line. Sanji then says that they need to get out of there and asks Nami about what they should do. Nami says they don't need to do anything and Sanji listened. The Straw Hats asked one of the whales to give them a ride to the surface of the New World. Brook sang a song for the whales so they can bring them to the surface. Before they got to the surface the Straw Hats remembered the times during their training to become stronger so they can regroup and head towards the New World. They finally surfaced and Thousand Sunny hopped off the whales and landed onto the ocean. The Straw Hats say goodbye to the whales and they see some ships claiming they are pirate ships but then they saw that the ships belong to the Marines."

Huge raindrops appear out of nowhere, and the water suddenly splits. The Straw Hats wake up with different clothes. However, Sanji sees that the food he cooked is gone, so he blames it on Luffy, Usopp, and Chopper until Chopper wonders if the sea is haunted. Suddenly, the food begins to be eaten very quickly. Luffy finds the person who ate the food and it turns out to be a little girl. She attacks the Straw Hats and they fight back. It is then revealed that she ate the Mini Mini no Mi and that her name is Lily. She turns out to be a giant, though her devil fruit makes her small. She befriends the Straw Hats after they save her from drowning and wants to see her dad (this is why she invaded the Marine's fleet of ships). She then talks about food to Luffy. On the Neo Marines' ship, Ain calls Shuzo and asks why he was not there. Shuzo tells Ain that he will make a better second-in-command and that he is going after Lily's father. The Straw Hats see Marine ships coming their way who have Lily's father captive. They are heading towards Impel Down, so Luffy declares battle against the Marines."

    "summary": "Celebrating Mr. Satan's victory at the IGO tournament, the group discovers that the tournament was planned with the ulterior motive of gathering the world's strongest fighters to capture the legendary Deep Sea Glutton creature Akami, which has the ability to suck the energy out of living things. The Akami appears and attacks Mr. Satan, Usopp and Gohan, poisoning them and absorbing their energy, before disappearing again; This leaves the group with only 30 minutes to find Akami and create an antidote to its poison. After defeating Sanji, Piccolo, Franky, Gotenks and others, Akami evolves into an even more powerful monster, even gaining the ability to absorb and use the power of energy attacks intended to stop it. Luffy and Toriko distract the monster while Goku charges a Spirit Bomb using the energy from everyone at the tournament. This attack, along with a simultaneous finishing move from all three combatants, defeats Akami, and the group resumes their banquet. Neither Zoro, Zebra or Vegeta participate, as they have been fighting each other since the tournament began.\n\n\nNote: This episode is a crossover with Toriko and Dragon Ball Z which continues from Episode 99 of Toriko. Due to licensing restrictions, Funimation skipped this episode in every official release until March 2023."

Meanwhile, Luffy faces Monet off and almost dies in the battle, due to having his body frozen, but recovers and counters with Haki. The counterattack, however, made a hole in the floor, leading to the garbage room, where Luffy fell to, and Monet gives farewell to him, as \"he can only escape flying\". Trafalgar Law prepares to attack the SAD Room, but is confronted by Vergo, who gives critical punches with his Haki-powered fists and bamboo. In the biscuit room, Monet prevents Mocha from fleeing with the candy, and the Straw Hats also help Mocha. After seriously wounding Law, Vergo is confronted by Vice-Admiral Smoker, who prepares to fight the other Vice-Admiral."

Diamante is also announced to be fighting in the next match. Meanwhile, at the palace, Viola shows Luffy's group a secret emergency lift that was kept hidden even from Doflamingo. Though stairs were also available, the group prefer to take the lift up with Luffy acting as counterweight. The battle at the Toy House rages on as Franky launches rockets at Senor Pink who, instead of using his Swim-Swim Fruit power which allows him to swim through the floor and walls, he takes a missile on the face, in order to protect Machvise who was unable to move. He then gets up and tries to flatten Franky with a body slam but misses. Before the fight could continue, the Marines show up surrounding the Toy House with the intent to arrest Franky. In the Palace, Fujitora reveals that his intention is to abolish the Warlord system. Doflamingo takes this as a threat and attacks him, but Fujitora says that his orders in defending the country from the Straw Hats still stand and once he deals with them, he will turn his attention towards Doflamingo. Back to the Colosseum, the final battle for the Flame-Flame Fruit is about to begin with a new battle platform and the first to step out is Lucy."

The next day, the Donquixote Pirates executives attack a pirate hideout and take their treasure. Baby 5 asks what Flevance was like and learn how it is a white city caused by the Amber Lead and used to create different types of goods. But, it would poison and erode the body if dug up and handled, something the World Government and Flevance royalty kept secret because of the fortune it would bring. It also consequentially shortens the lifespan by about 20 more years each generation, effectively killing the kids before adulthood. People eventually began to collapse at the same time due to the buildup of Amber Lead in their bodies and began to die with immense pain flooding their bodies. Surrounding countries placed a quarantine on Flevance because they thought it was contagious and the royalty escaped with the help of the World Government. However, Flevance wouldn't remain quiet as war broke out with neighboring countries showing no mercy. In the past, Flevance citizens were killed as soldiers gun down anyone they find. A nun tries to get Law to come with her and the other children after some soldiers promised to let them escape, but Law stays because his sister is dying. The nun promises to come back on the next ship to get Law and tells him that there is always hope and that a loving hand will one day reach out to him. Law's father tries to get help from other doctors but none will come, afraid of becoming infected. Elsewhere, Law stands next to his sister, Lami, who tells him that her body hurts and is turning more white every day.

In the past, Doflamingo, Rosinante, and Homing were hung from the windows of their burning house by ropes around their arms and blindfolded. A mob of commoners desired revenge for the suffering the Celestial Dragons had inflicted on them and debated how they should kill them, but keep them alive so they could suffer. The citizens recount the sufferings caused by the World Nobles, who had hurt them, their relatives, and their countries whenever they felt like it. Doflamingo screams in terror as a man demanded to know if they ever felt any kind of pain before waking up in a cold sweat as the Transponder Snail rings. After putting on his sunglasses and drinking alcohol, Doflamingo picks it up and is informed that Law did something. Seventeen years ago in Mariejois, several World Nobles expressed their shock at Homing and his family giving up their status to become normal humans. This prompted Homing to claim they had been human ever since they was born, offending the World Nobles. Soon after, they were taking to a non-member island in the North Blue with a house and assets prepared for them. Homing then handed over his family's World Noble identification chips and told his family that they would lead a humble life there. But, after Homing revealed that they moved from Mariejois, the people burned their house downed searching for them. The Donquixote Family watched in terror from the forest nearby and ran through a rainy forest to a run-down shack in a garbage dump where they took shelter. Then, they found shelter in a small village, and Homing contacted the World Nobles for help, however they refused and told him to never call again. Soon after, Doflamingo and Rosinante were caught stealing bread and were beat up as punishment and ate from a garbage pile before bringing their mother some food, only to find her sick. Eventually, she dies leaving Rosinante crying as Doflamingo blamed Homing for her death. the angry mob then finds them and Homing begs them to pardon his sons as Doflamingo cursed his father for bringing them to ruin. In the present, Giolla and Machvise bring Law to Doflamingo as Giolla reveals that they found him trying to escape. As Buffalo and Baby 5 watch, with Buffalo noting that they will torture Law for stabbing Corazon, Law notices Corazon is present and wonders if he will die. However, Doflamingo reveals that he called Law to welcome him to the Donquixote Pirates. Doflamingo explains how Law has a certain quality in his eyes after experiencing such a horrible past, while Law wonders why Corazon has not yet told Doflamingo what happened. When Law points out that he is going to die in three years regardless, but Doflamingo claims that this depends on his luck before explaining how they specialize the black market and handle Devil Fruits, which means there could be a fruit that can cure him. Doflamingo states that he will train Law to become his right-hand man in ten years. Corazon begins coughing and reveals the wound on his abdomen, prompting Doflamingo to ask what happened. However, Corazon communicates that an enemy caused it and he finished him off, prompting Doflamingo to tell him to get his wound treated as a shocked Law wonders if Corazon covered up for him. Later, Doflamingo informs his crew that they will be moving their base toward Reverse Mountain while expanding their business. As they were moving across the sea, they engaged in combat with the Marines and pulled bank heists. At one point, Law and Baby 5 were attacked by a pirate named Wellington, but were saved by Doflamingo and his executives. Law began studying under Doflamingo, training with firearms under Gladius, learning martial arts with Lao G, and practicing swordsmanship with Diamante. Two years later, Baby 5 and Buffalo tell Law their real names, but he initially refuses to tell them his. However, Buffalo claims that he will tell Doflamingo of Law stabbing Corazon two years ago if he does not reveal his true name, prompting Law to reveal his full name is Trafalgar D. Water Law, which alerts Corazon. Law admits that he should not be telling them this because his family has kept the initial D. a secret for many generations, and is irritated when Baby 5 and Buffalo complain about it not being interesting. However, Law is suddenly grabbed by the collar and hauled away by Corazon. After being thrown into an alley, Corazon asks Law if what he said before is true. A surprised Law finds out Corazon can speak and Corazon tells him to get away because he should not be around Doflamingo with the initial D. in his name."

Across the island, Tank Lepanto and the crowd of citizens on the King's Plateau decide to climb down to the city in order to assist their former king Riku. Viola confirms to Zoro and Usopp that of the opposing forces, only Doflamingo and Trebol remain standing, but their own forces have also taken a hit. Meanwhile, Luffy breaks through the palace roof, eager to fight Doflamingo. The Warlord taunts him about Bellamy and blocks a Gear Third punch with Spider's Web. Luffy leaps over the web and uses Hawk Gatling to attack Doflamingo from above, but Doflamingo uses Break White to surround Luffy in a mass of strings. Luffy breaks out of Doflamingo's trap but steps on a pool of blood. Looking around, he sees Law lying on the ground. In confusion, Luffy asks Law what has happened, but he remains unresponsive. Doflamingo tells Luffy that Law is dead, shocking the pirate. As the citizens of Dressrosa realize that the Birdcage is shrinking, Doflamingo mocks Law's last words and states that it is time for the game to end. Luffy prepares to fight but faintly hears Law's voice telling him to listen closely."
