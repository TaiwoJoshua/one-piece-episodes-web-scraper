    <summary>In the ocean, Alvida and her pirate crew attack a cruise ship. Coby, a slave of Alvida, discovers a barrel. One of Alvida's pirates attempts to open the barrel, but a young boy emerges and accidentally hits him. The remaining pirates attack him, but the stranger stops them and says that his name is Monkey D. Luffy. Luffy drags Coby to the storage cellar of the ship, where he eats and converses with Coby, who reveals his dream of being a marine. Alvida confronts Luffy, but he escapes and knocks her pirate crew down with his Devil Fruit power. Luffy explains that he ate the Gum-Gum Fruit, therefore he has the properties of rubber. Coby, inspired by Luffy, stands up for himself when Alvida confronts them. Luffy uses his Gum-Gum Pistol technique on Alvida. Luffy and Coby sail away in a "borrowed" boat from Alvida's crew. Luffy asks about the pirate hunter Coby mentioned earlier. Coby says that he was captured by the Marines, and Luffy announces his intention of asking him to join his crew.</summary>

    <summary>In a flashback, a seven-year-old Luffy sits in a bar filled with the pirate crew of the "Red-Haired" Shanks, begging him to take him out to sea. But the pirate captain refuses. A bandit named Higuma enters and orders several barrels of booze. Shanks offers him the last bottle but Higuma smashes it and humiliates Shanks. After the bandit leaves the bar, all of the pirates start to laugh. Luffy gets angry that Shanks did not fight back and in a huff eats a purple fruit lying on the bar. Shanks notices this and tries to make Luffy spit it out, but it was too late. Shanks tells Luffy that he just ate the Gum Gum Fruit, a Devil Fruit, and now he is a rubber man and won't be able to ever swim again. Later, Luffy gets attacked by Higuma and his bandits. He is about to be killed, when Shanks and his crew arrive and effortlessly defeat Higuma's men. Frightened, Higuma throws down a smoke bomb and makes his escape, taking Luffy with him. He flees out to sea in a boat. There he throws the non-swimmer into the water. As Higuma laughs at Luffy's plight, a Sea King appears behind him and devours him whole. The sea monster then goes for Luffy, but Shanks stops the sea monster as it takes a bite, and with one look, drives the beast away. Luffy clutches Shanks and starts crying, since Shanks' arm was bitten off by the creature. Shanks replies that it is fine, as long as Luffy is safe. As the pirates get ready to leave, Luffy decides he will become a pirate on his own, that he will gather a crew that will beat Shanks', and that he will become King of the Pirates. Shanks gives his straw hat to Luffy and tells him to return it some day, as a great pirate. Back in the present, Luffy slingshots into the sky to catch a bird. Instead he is caught himself. Zoro, now alone in their boat, tries to keep up, paddling. On his way he picks up three castaways from Buggy's crew. The bird, carrying Luffy flies over a town, where it is shot down by Buggy's men. Luffy falls down and lands right in front of Nami, who is running away from Buggy's crew for stealing their precious map to the Grand Line.</summary>

Later, Kaya is crying in her room. Klahadore enters to bring her a meal and reminds her of the day he came to the mansion, when he was battered and her father took him in. He then claims that if anything happened to Kaya, he would not forgive himself. The Usopp Pirates, Nami, and Zoro encounter Jango , who claims to be only a passing hypnotist. He then hypnotizes the Usopp Pirates — and accidentally himself — into falling asleep in the middle of the road. Later, by a cliff overlooking the ocean, Luffy and Usopp witness Jango and Klahadore — whose true identity turns out to be that of the infamous pirate Captain Kuro—plotting a raid of the village and a murder of Kaya. Luffy yells at them not to get rid of Kaya, but Jango uses his hypnotism to put Luffy to sleep, causing him to fall off the cliff. He lands on his head and appears to be dead. They do not worry about Usopp knowing, because of his reputation as a liar.</summary>

    <summary>Usopp, Luffy, Zoro, and Nami formulate a plan on the slope for when the pirates come. Meanwhile, Kuro breaks the glasses Kaya gave him and injures Merry with his clawed glove. Kuro then steps into Kaya's room, and he holds his blood-stained claw over Kaya's head, remembering the deed he has to commit the following day. By the coast, the Black Cat Pirates' ship approaches Syrup Village. Jango reiterates the plan to his men. Meanwhile, Luffy, Usopp, Zoro, and Nami stand on the slope leading to the village, and have poured a barrel of oil on it to make it slippery. The plan is that when the Black Cat Pirates slip on the oil, the four will spring out and attack them. Dawn breaks, and so the Black Cat Pirates land on the coast, spotting Luffy's boat. At that moment, Luffy and the others are waiting for the pirates as the sun has now risen, and Nami hears the pirates coming from the north. Usopp notes that there is an identical slope at the north end of the village, and they realize they are at the wrong coast. Panicking, Nami then realizes that their ship is located at the north coast, and their treasure will be robbed by the pirates. Luffy and Usopp take off running for the coast. Zoro and Nami start to leave, but Nami slips on the oil and drags Zoro down the slope, stepping on him to climb back up. Zoro is unable to get up the slippery slope, and he slides to the bottom, but eventually uses his swords to pull his way up. At the north coast, Usopp arrives, surprised that Luffy hasn't come yet, who is now lost. The Black Cat Pirates arrive, and Usopp stands up to them, but realizes he can't beat them by himself. He sees the pirates taking the treasure from the Straw Hats' ship, and he says that the treasure belongs to him, and he'll give it to them if they leave. Jango decides to hypnotize Usopp instead, but Nami arrives in the nick of time and whacks Usopp in the head, knocking him over, refusing to give up her treasure. Usopp then reports that Luffy has not arrived yet, and is probably lost. The Black Cat Pirates then charge, and Usopp stands up to them, but they knock him down swiftly. Usopp struggles to fight them, but there are far too many. He is shocked when they are all sent flying back, and sees that Luffy and Zoro have arrived. Zoro yells at Nami about leaving him there, and Luffy yells at Usopp for not telling him which was north. However, united, the four face off against the invading Black Cat Pirates.</summary>

    <summary>Jango kneels beside the fallen pirates and starts to hypnotize them. Once the hypnotism takes effect, the pirates became wild and ravenous, and foaming at their mouths, they charge at the Straw Hats. One pounds down a cliff with his fist. Zoro says that he and Luffy will handle it, but Luffy was also hypnotized, becoming a wild animal himself. Luffy charges down the slope and uses his Gum Gum Gatling technique to plow through the pirates with ease. Luffy keeps charging, and soon runs past the pirates, causing Jango to fear that he will be the next target. Luffy takes the bow of Kuro's ship in an attempt to kill him, but Jango hypnotizes Luffy, and so Luffy falls asleep, the bow falling on top of him and squishing him as he does this. With Luffy out of the way, Jango prepares for the next attack. Seeing the pirates are defeated, he calls for Siam and Butchie and orders them to attack. They turn out to be cowards, but after some heavy persuasion they charge for Zoro. Zoro blocks their claws with his sword, and engages in a great fight with the two Meowban Brothers. Zoro slashes Siam through the lowersection, but finds out Siam has a very thin waist. He sits on top of Zoro and Buchie leaps down, but Zoro manages to avoid the bone-crushing attack that leaves a crater. Butchie then uses his cat-like abilities to steal Zoro's two swords, and throws them away. Zoro has no chance to grab them and faces another assault by the Nyaban Brothers. Usopp decides to help and fires at the brothers, but Zoro blocks it with his back, yelling at Nami and Usopp to not get themselves killed. Nami then runs for Zoro's swords, picking them up, but Jango reacts swiftly and slashes her in the shoulder with his chakram. Just as Jango and the others are about to kill the Straw Hats, Kuro appears, annoyed that his plan has foiled.</summary>

    <summary>The episode begins with Kuro standing impatiently. Siam and Butchie decide that Kuro, having been inactive for three years, has lost his edge, and that they can defeat him. They charge at Kuro but only swing at thin air, and Kuro appears behind them, holding his claws to their necks. He says that everyone has five minutes to finish their job, or he will kill them all. He releases the Meowban Brothers, pushing them so that they can continue their battle with Zoro. However, Nami sees her chance and kicks Zoro's swords through the air. Zoro catches them, and as the Meowban Brothers charge at him he unleashes a great Toragiri, taking both of them down with one mighty swing. He turns to Kuro and declares he won't even need five minutes. Nami realizes how dangerous Kuro is, and so runs to wake up Luffy. As she runs, Jango spots her, and hurls a chakram at her. Nami turns and steps on Luffy's face, waking up Luffy abruptly. He springs up, pulling Nami down just as the chakram strikes him right in the mouth. Luffy stays standing, though, and he breaks the chakram with his teeth. He then sees Nami is wounded, and furious, prepares for battle with Kuro. At the mansion, Kaya wakes up from a nightmare, and she heads down the stairs to find Merry leaning against the wall, bloody and wounded. Merry explains the whole situation to Kaya, how Kuro is planning to take kill her and take her money in a will. Kaya realizes that Usopp was telling the truth the entire time, and so she puts on her overcoat and sets out. She arrives at the top of the slope, and tells Kuro to stop immediately, and that Merry told her everything. Kuro turns to her and wonders why Merry isn't dead, and Kaya sees the state Usopp is in. Usopp charges in and aims a punch at Kuro's face, but Kuro avoids the swing and so Usopp careens into the ground. Kaya then pulls out a gun and points it at Kuro, ordering him to leave the village. Kuro reminds Kaya of the fun times they had together, and Kaya hesitates. Kuro takes the gun from Kaya's hands, knowing she won't shoot, and he drops it to the ground. Usopp picks up the gun and fires at Kuro, but Kuro sidesteps the shot and knocks Usopp down. From out of nowhere flies Luffy's fist, striking Kuro in the face. As Kuro falls back, Luffy retracts his arm and declares that he has a hundred more where that came from.</summary>

    <summary>The episode begins with the Usopp Pirates and Kaya running from Jango through the forest. Jango hurls his chakram and cuts down many trees, searching everywhere for them, and Kaya falls down. She tells the Usopp Pirates to run before they are killed, but they stay and fight, deciding to follow their captain's orders and fight to the death for Kaya. Back at the slope, Kuro claims that he hated being a pirate. Luffy refuses to be like him and Kuro uses his Silent Step to move quickly. Luffy gets the timing right, however, and pounds Kuro down. Kuro gets back up and announces that he is going to kill his entire crew, and that it was part of his plan from the beginning. Luffy claims that Usopp could beat Kuro. Kuro laughs it off and uses Shakushi, causing him to disappear. As Luffy wonders where he went, Nami finishes up looting the Black Cat pirate ship, disappointed by the amount of treasure. She then wonders if the battle is over, but sees that Kuro slashes through several of his crewmates, taking them down quicker than the naked eye can see. Luffy gets even more angry, but just after Kuro slashes him in the chest, he grabs Kuro's arm and slams him onto the ground. Kuro stands up and says that now his crew is suffering because Luffy wouldn't let them die quickly, and so Kuro uses Shakushi once again to disappear. In the forest, at that moment, Jango continues searching for the Usopp Pirates, and they toss him a white flag. Jango walks forward and so the Usopp Pirates launch their ambush. Jango trips over a rope and one of the Usopp Pirates showers him with pepper, making him sneeze. The second jumps out and strikes Jango in the groin with a frying pan. The third leaps down from a large rock and takes a swing at Jango's head, but Jango sits up in time and knocks his attacker away. Kaya then comes out, telling Jango not to hurt the kids, but Jango reports that it was his orders from Kuro to kill the children. Kaya then grabs Jango's chakram and holds it in front of her throat, threatening to kill herself without writing the will. Jango agrees, and so he gets Kaya to write the will. Once finished, he grabs her by the neck and holds her against a tree, holding up a chakram to kill her. Zoro is still running through the woods with Usopp on his back, and Usopp spots Jango. Kuro slices up the rocks, followed by cutting up Luffy's left shoulder as he glances in anger as the episode ends.</summary>

    <summary>The episode opens with Usopp pretending he is in a great battle as captain of the Going Merry, fending off attacking pirates. As he is doing so, Luffy announces that he has finished the pirate flag for their ship, and holds it up. It's a terribly drawn skull and crossbones, of course. The others are horrified of the artwork, and so Usopp tells them that he is a great painter. He paints a pirate flag with his own face on it, but the others reject it so he paints a proper pirate flag, a very nice one at that. They fly it on the mast and continue to sail. As they are sailing, Nami spots an island in the distance with her telescope, saying it is Legendary Treasure Island. Usopp says how he heard that there is a valuable treasure on the island, but if one tries to claim it they will face God's wrath. As the Straw Hats draw nearer to the island, the weather turns foul and the waters very choppy. After a tough sail they make it to the island. The Straw Hats head into the jungle, looking for treasure. Zoro lies down and starts to nap, and as Usopp is shocked at how he can sleep in a creepy place like this, the Straw Hats find themselves surrounded by strange animals, creatures that are combinations of two or more animals. A voice booms through the jungle, claiming to be the Guardian God of the island and telling them to leave. Luffy picks up a lion pig that bites him on the face. The voice is shocked and Luffy explains he ate the Devil's Fruit. A gun then pokes out through a bush and shoots Luffy in the back, but Luffy bounces the bullet into the air with his Gum Gum powers. Luffy then spots a twitching green bush, and the owner of the voice takes off running. Luffy, Usopp, and Nami catch up to the man in the treasure chest, named Gaimon. Luffy explains to him how he wants to go to the Grand Line and claim One Piece, but Gaimon doesn't think he can do it. Luffy and Gaimon converse about how they can't read a map, and Nami is angered by this. Gaimon then explains how he became trapped in the treasure box as Zoro finally joins them. He explains that twenty years ago, he was with his crew in search of the treasure, and as they were leaving, he noticed how the captain never searched on top of a large cliff. Gaimon scaled the cliff but slipped and fell, getting stuck in a treasure box. He found that his crew had left, and he thought he would have the treasure on the ridge to himself, but found he could not climb in the box. When Luffy tries to pull Gaimon out of the box, he explains that his body grew to match the shape of the box, and his body will be ruined if the box is broken. Luffy then realizes that Gaimon uses the strange animals of the island to ward off visitors. Inspired by Gaimon's story, the Straw Hats decide to help Gaimon find the treasure. They come to the ridge and Luffy uses Gum Gum Rocket to launch himself up to the top, where there are five treasure chests. He refuses to hand them over to Gaimon, and while this shocks and angers Nami and Usopp, Gaimon realizes that the treasure boxes must be empty. Luffy confirms this, and so Gaimon begins to cry, saying that he's been guarding nothing for twenty years. Luffy says it could be worse, as he could have died guarding nothing, and he offers Gaimon to join their crew. Gaimon decides to stay with the strange animals of the island, however, as he has decided to protect them instead of the treasure. With this adventure behind them, the Straw Hats set sail in the Going Merry once again, waving goodbye to Gaimon as the episode draws to a close.</summary>

    <summary>After a review of the ending of the previous episode, the episode begins with Marine Lieutenant Iron Fist Fullbody pouring a drink to a beautiful lady on his marine ship and saying how he is taking her to the greatest restaurant in the world. The lady then questions if the restaurant is in the middle of the ocean, which Fullbody answers by telling her to just look forward to it. In the meantime, on the Going Merry, Zoro recognizes the intruder who got beat up by Luffy from the last episode as Johnny. Johnny then brings the straw hat pirates' attention to Yosaku, who lies ill on his and Johnny's small ship. Turns out that Johnny, Yosaku, and Zoro used to be bounty hunter partners some time ago. Johnny then proceeds to tell the straw hat pirates that he took Yosaku to a small rock island to rest, which was coincidentally blown up by Usopp and Luffy for target practice in the last episode. Usopp and Luffy quickly apologize. Johnny, however, was more worried about Yosaku's condition, which Nami quickly diagnosed as scurvy caused by a lack of Vitamin C. Luffy and Usopp then shove a bunch of lemons into Yosaku's mouth and Yosaku is revived!... or at least for 5 minutes. The straw hat pirates conclude that they need a cook for their potential nutritional problems. Johnny points out that they probably can find a good candidate in the floating sea restaurant known as Baratie. He also states that the one Zoro has been looking for, Hawk-eyes Mihawk, is near there too. Thus they head to Baratie, which actually is pretty much right next to where they were. They are then passed by Fullbody's marine ship. Fullbody doesn't recognize the straw hat pirates mark, but he recognizes Johnny and Yosaku as worthless pirate hunters. Johnny responds by shouting "this is what pirate hunters do" while throwing a bunch of wanted posters in the air. Nami takes note of the Arlong poster with an angry look and crumbles the poster in her hands. Fullbody then orders his crew to sink the pirate ship. Luffy attempts to deflect the cannon but after losing his grip accidentally deflects it to the head chief's room in Baratie, where the head chief was subsequently injured and demands that Luffy work off his crime by working for the restaurant for one year. In Baratie, while attempting to impress his girlfriend, Fullbody instead becomes humiliated by Sanji's witty remarks. Turns out that Sanji is actually the Assistant Head Chef. Frustrated, Fullbody destroys his table full of food. Sanji, who is angry that Fullbody wasted precious food, beats Fullbody up.</summary>

    <summary>After a review of the last episode, the episode begins with Patty, a cook for Baratie, picking his nose in the bathroom while making a monologue about how serving the customers who have money is the number one concern for a restaurant. Upon leaving the bathroom, Patty becomes furious when he sees that Sanji is beating up Fullbody, who is a customer. Sanji replies that customer or not, Fullbody insulted a chef and his food. At this moment, the head chef and Luffy come crashing down from the ceiling because the head chef was kicking Luffy too hard while trying to convince him that he has to work at Baratie for a whole year to pay off his debt. The head chef then kicks Sanji to calm him down and also kicks Fullbody out of the restaurant. Fullbody's subordinate then comes running into the restaurant yelling that their prisoner, a member of Don Krieg's pirates, has escaped. The customers are terrified because Don Krieg is supposedly the strongest pirate in East Blue. The pirate shoots the marine from behind and comes in to order food. Patty recognizes the pirate as a customer and asks if the pirate has any money on him. The pirate points a gun at Patty and says "is a bullet okay?" Patty then beats the pirate up and doesn't recognize the pirate as a customer since he has no money. Sanji, on the other hand, heads to the kitchen and starts making a meal. Fullbody in the meantime, leaves the restaurant sneakily (along with the subordinate who got shot earlier, guess he is still alive). Sanji brings his meal to the pirate, who was thrown out by Patty. Sanji states that, for him, a customer is anybody who is hungry. He also states that he understands the feeling of starvation more than anybody else. The pirate then grabs the meal and gobbles it up, while crying and saying that this is the most delicious dish he has ever had in his entire life. Luffy, who was watching the whole thing, attempts to recruit Sanji as the cook for his crew. After refusing and some conversing, we find out that the head chef used to be a notorious pirate and the restaurant often comes into conflict with other pirates after his fame. Luffy, as always, is stubborn and insists that Sanji joins them. We also find out that the other pirate's name is Gin. Meanwhile, in the kitchen, we learn that Don Krieg is the captain of a fleet of 50 ships. Gin thanks Sanji for the meal and leaves. Sanji throws the dishes into the ocean to get rid of the evidence that Sanji is giving out food for free, which makes Gin even more grateful. Luffy is then sent back to work, where he ends up breaking even more dishes and makes a big commotion in the kitchen. The rest of the crew, Zoro, Nami, and Usopp, turn out to be eating a meal at the restaurant. Sanji, after seeing Nami, is captivated by her beauty. While flirting with Nami, the head chef tells Sanji that he's annoying and that he doesn't need him anymore. Meanwhile, Gin informs Don Krieg of the restaurant, where Don Krieg makes clear his intention to "visit" the restaurant.</summary>

He then begs Don Krieg to leave the Baratie alone but Krieg is just disgusted with this show of emotion. Because of this, Ghin is no longer a member of the Krieg pirates and Don Krieg decides to have him executed.

Even Ghin and the Krieg pirates are shocked at this length of execution and are quick to put on their masks (except Ghin who throws his in the water). The Baratie chefs swim away while Patty and Carne run inside with Zeff and Luffy attempts to make a beeline for Krieg but is thrown back by the Needle Gun concealed in the launcher shoulder pad. Krieg fires the MH5 while Luffy steals two masks from two Krieg pirates and throws them to Sanji and Ghin. He turns round to get another for himself but the pirates have vanished.

Arlong forces the villagers to pay him in tribute or be killed (100,000 berries per adult and 50,000 per child). When the Fishmen arrive at Bellemere's house, she tries to fight back but is easily subdued. Having only 100,000 berries, Bellemere uses it to save Nami and Nojiko, which results in Arlong killing her. Seeing a map skillfully drawn by Nami, Arlong kidnaps her and shanghaies her into joining the Arlong Pirates to make maps and charts for them. Arlong does make a deal with Nami: if she can gather 100,000,000 berries for him, Arlong will free Cocoyashi Village. It is shown that for the last eight years Nami has stolen countless amounts of money from other pirates, thus explaining why she stole the Going Merry from the Straw Hats.</summary>

Meanwhile, Luffy and two individuals, crash into the whale's stomach. As Crocus returns, they shot two cannonballs from their bazookas, to rip a hole in the whale's stomach, but Crocus takes the cannonballs with his own body. Then Luffy knocks them both out. Leading the Straw Hats out of the whale, Crocus explains that Laboon is a whale with a heart like a person, who has been waiting for a certain group of pirates for fifty years.[n 5]</summary>

After their fight, which, like thousands before it, ends in a draw, Dorry receives two barrels of booze from Broggy, which he obtained from Nami and Usopp. Unbeknown to the four, the contents of one of the barrels is made to explode by Mr. 5. When Dorry later drinks it and it badly injures him from within, he accuses the Straw Hats. Left with no choice, Luffy fights the weakened giant and knocks him out. However, by the time of the next eruption of the center volcano, Dorry gets back up and heads into battle, knowing his chances to be bad.</summary>

    <summary>Before he leaves to face his rival and friend for a last time, Dorry traps Luffy under a huge rock. While the giants fight, Nami and Usopp try to cross the jungle to meet up with Luffy and Vivi at Dorry's camp. While once again fleeing from a hungry dinosaur, Nami is distracted by a life-sized facsimile of Luffy and captivated by Mr. 3's Wax-Wax Fruit powers, which allow him to generate wax. Zoro is captured in a similar way. Usopp arrives alone at Dorry's camp, shortly followed by Mr. 5 and Miss Valentine. The giants' manipulated duel ends in defeat for Dorry. Broggy, who stands in tears over the lifeless body of his friend, is addressed by Mr. 3, who already encased the giant's feet in iron-hard wax. Mr. 5 captures Vivi, while his partner stomps Usopp chest-deep into the ground.</summary>

    <summary>After explosively beating down on the still trapped Luffy, Mr. 5 and his partner take Vivi to the giants' duel site, where Mr. 3 is busy further restraining Broggy with his wax. After that, Mr. 3 creates a large, cake-shaped pedestal upon which Vivi, Nami, and Zoro are placed. On top of the pedestal, he creates a rotating platform upon which he places several large candles, which spray wax over his prisoners, slowly turning them into wax figures. Then he explains to Broggy how he manipulated their duel, causing the giant to burst out in anger and break his restraints. However, before he can completely free himself, Mr. 5 knocks the giant out with several explosions and Mr. 3 renews the restraints. Meanwhile, Karoo, Vivi's ostrich sized duck, digs out Luffy from under the rock. The bird, Luffy, and Usopp arrive at the scene just as Zoro attempts to free himself by cutting off his legs.</summary>

He burns Luffy's shirt, upon which Miss Golden Week had painted, using a flaming projectile. Luffy, again himself, attempts to destroy the pedestal but is interrupted by the returning Mr. 3, who creates himself a waxen battle suit. Usopp is finally struck down by Mr. 5's explosive shots, but is still able to make Karoo run around the pedestal dragging behind it a rope, which Usopp soaks in flammable oil. Luffy, then, grabs Mr. 3 at his burning, three-shaped hairdo and uses it to inflame the rope, burning the large wax structure and freeing the others. As they emerge from the flames, Nami and Vivi defeat Miss Valentine and Zoro makes quick work of Mr. 5. Luffy and Karoo chase after Mr. 3 and his partner and defeat them, respectively. Meanwhile, Sanji stumbles upon Mr. 3's hideout, where he receives a call from Mr. 0.</summary>

    <summary>Once Sanji realizes that he is talking to Crocodile, he pretends being Mr. 3 and convinces the Warlord that he has eliminated Vivi and her Straw Hat escort. During the conversation, Crocodile's messengers, the otter, and its partner, the vulture, called the Unluckies, arrive to deliver an eternal pose, leading to Alabasta, to Mr. 3. They attack Sanji, but he defeats them. To justify the noisy interruption, Sanji tells Mr. 0 that one of the Straw Hats was still alive. Crocodile tells him to return to Alabasta, then, after the conversation, orders Mr. 2 to intercept and eliminate Mr. 3 en route for his failure to make accurate reports. While Broggy creates a rainfall of tears, Dorry wakes up and concludes that, after a hundred years, Broggy's axe had gotten dull and only knocked him out. Using the eternal pose to guide them, the crew sets sail. Dorry and Broggy see them off, and, to thank them, sacrifice their worn out weapons to kill a giant goldfish as it attempts to feed on the Straw Hats' ship. [n 12]</summary>

    <summary>The Straw Hats continue to do Zenny's daily work and finish building his pirate ship, which he intends to use as a coffin. Zoro eventually realizes that the three days until Zenny's death, which Chopper had diagnosed, have long passed, but by the time he convinces the others to leave, Nami has already lost the Straw Hats' ship in a game of chess. Robin wins it back and they all have a party. As Zenny becomes drunk, he recollects his past as a moneylender who lent money to pirates. He describes how he was shipwrecked twenty years earlier, and that he, in hopes of one day becoming a pirate, started building a ship. As the years passed, he became too old for a pirate's life. Luffy disagrees, saying that pirates can be of any age. The next day, a group of marines lures the Straw Hats into a trap. To save them, Zenny and his goats ride his ship down the mountainside.</summary>

    <summary>The commotion caused by Zenny's arrival allows Nami, Sanji, Usopp, and Chopper to board their ship safely. Zenny and his goats get on the navy ship and Zenny uses of his martial arts skills, with a counting frame to fight. Luffy attempts to slingshot himself over to help him, but lands in the water instead. Zoro immediately jumps in after him to rescue the non-swimmer, only to be run over by the Straw Hats' own ship. The marines are eventually defeated, but a fleet of nine more ships is still waiting in the fog surrounding the island. Zenny tells the Straw Hats that, on his arrival on the island, the goats ate all of his money and that they became his treasure instead. The Straw Hats give Zenny enough medicine to survive and leave the island, escaping from the navy.</summary>

    <summary>After escaping from another fleet of navy ships, the Straw Hats drop anchor outside a town with a huge tower. After they set foot on land, an official demands that they pay a harbor tax. The Straw Hats meet a scientist named Henzo, who asks them if they have seen what he calls the "Rainbow Mist." The other citizens of the town dislike Henzo because they have to pay high taxes to fund for his research. While shopping with Nami and Chopper, Sanji has a violent encounter with a tax collector, who is wearing an electric battle suit. A large, unmanned galley appears in the harbor, in the same condition that Henzo saw it fifty years ago. Henzo, Luffy, Robin, and Usopp board it. Further out at sea, a rainbow-colored mist appears and the group uses the Straw Hats' ship to enter it.</summary>

    <summary>Inside the mist, Luffy and his group discover a large ship graveyard. Luffy salvages a chest filled with gold and jewels from one of the shipwrecks, but a distant voice tells him to return the treasure and leave the mist. Usopp believes the voices to be ghosts, but they actually originate from a group of children who call themselves the Pumpkin Pirates. In his youth, Henzo was a member of this group, and they are the reason for his research. He spent his life in search of a means to rescue them from the Rainbow Mist. Only a short time earlier from their point of view, but fifty years earlier from Henzo's perspective, a group of pirates, led by a Captain Whetton, attacked the children's town. When Whetton came after the children, they tried to escape by stealing the pirates' ship. During the fight, Whetton smashed the ship's helm, and Henzo jumped overboard, taking Whetton with him, while the other children sailed into the mist.</summary>

    <summary>After entering the Rainbow Mist, the children followed the orders of Ian, the only pirate left on the ship. He mistreated them and they eventually locked him up in the brig of the wreck of a navy ship. Luffy and his group try to escape the mist, but they soon realize that they need help. The Straw Hats persuade one of the children to lead them to the Pumpkin Pirates' hiding place so they can ask them for a way out. Usopp prepares a steaming meal, which causes most of the children to like the Straw Hats; however, their leader, Lapanui, remains suspicious and unwilling to help. Henzo's transponder snail rings and the son of Whetton wants Henzo to investigate the mist, not knowing that the professor is already inside the mist. When Lapanui hears Whetton's name, he loses what little trust he has for Henzo.</summary>

Usopp tells Lapanui that Henzo had endured the same insults from the townspeople yet still tried to rescue the children. Then, for no apparent reason, Luffy slingshots himself and Lapanui to another part of the mist. At the harbor, Nami ties a long lifeline, prepared by Henzo, to a boat and enters the Rainbow Mist. Once inside, Ian, who convinced one of the children to release him, steals the boat and escapes. He reaches Whetton and describes to him the mist's treasures. Whetton orders his men to invade the mist. The town's large tower falls into the water, creating a bridge from the island into the mist, and Whetton and his men cross it to attack.</summary>

    <summary>Luffy and Lapanui are outside the mist and use the newly created bridge to re-enter it. There, Luffy fights Whetton and, as it becomes clear that he cannot defeat Luffy face-to-face, Whetton detonates the tower, trapping everyone else inside and Whetton's abandoned men join forces with Luffy's group. An exit appears in the distance and they row toward it, but it closes too fast for them to reach it. Hoping to generate enough wind to blow the Straw Hats' ship clear of the mist, Lapanui stays behind to destroy the navy ship's armory. The other children follow him, promising to meet Henzo again. The explosion they cause successfully blows the Straw Hats' ship outside the mist. There, a group of navy ships, led by an aged Lapanui, arrives and confiscates the Rainbow Mist's treasures from Whetton and takes him and his men into custody.</summary>

    <summary>Nami finds out a way to get to Eneru and sends a message to the others for them to cut down Giant Jack. Zoro cuts down half of the stalk, but Eneru fires a bolt straight at Zoro, rendering him unconscious. As the others look on hopelessly, Wyper lets his pride get the better of him, saying that the descendants of Calgara should ring the bell. Usopp tries to help in a knowingly futile attempt by using his Exploding Star techniques. Robin tells Wyper that Cricket, Noland's descendant, is searching for the Gold City and Luffy wants to ring the bell for him. Reinvigorated, Wyper goes to Giant Jack and uses one final Reject, knocking down the rest of the stalk in the process. Nami and Luffy then charge up Giant Jack to face Eneru.</summary>

    <summary>Professor Clover is allowed to speak with one of the Elder Stars and reports of their research. He describes a civilization that existed hundreds of years ago and vanished at the time that the world government assumed power. He considers the collective evidence, which leads him to believe that the government tried to erase their former enemies from history. After stating that Ohara has learned too much, the Elder Star orders Spandaine to kill the professor and to give the order to destroy the island. Suddenly, the library is set aflame; while the scholars try to save the books, Robin admits to being an archeologist and unites with her mother. However, their union does not last long. Around them, cannon shots from the Buster Call's battleships start to hail down and Olvia sends her daughter off with Saul to flee the island, while she joins the effort to save the library's knowledge.</summary>

Vize-Admiral Kuzan, later known as Admiral Aokiji, enters the scene to engage in battle with Saul. While they fight, the evacuation ship is sunk by the fanatical Vice-Admiral Sakazuki, later known as Admiral Akainu. Saul, on the verge of dying, instructs Robin to flee on his raft. Persuaded by Saul's argument and Sakazuki's action, Kuzan helps Robin escape. From then on, Robin lives a life on the run, not being able to trust even the kindest of people, in a world that believes that her existence alone is a sin. In the present, Robin admits her greatest fear: to be seen as a burden by her crewmates and cast away, because being with her means having the world as their enemy. Finally knowing what kept her away, Sogeking, on Luffy's order, burns the government's flag, declaring war against the World Government itself.</summary>

    <summary>As Zoro's strategy to use Usopp as a weapon falls apart, Chopper's breather concludes as an overweight Kumadori frees himself from the fridge after eating everything inside. But Kumadori uses his Life Return ability to digest the eaten food and regain his usual figure, explaining the ability to a fascinated Chopper before they resume their fight. Chopper quickly realizes that he cannot break through Kumadori's body-hardening technique without the effect of his Rumble Ball drug. Regardless of the risk as he already used one to save Nami and should not take another for six hours, Chopper uses a second Rumble Ball. Despite the erratic transformations, Chopper manages to enter Armed Point to land a hit on Kumadori. However, the attack only infuriated Kumadori as he beats the now weakened Chopper to submission before preparing for the deathblow. But Chopper, remembering Kureha warning him not to take the risk again after learning of the devastation he caused the first time he did it, is left with no recourse but to use a third Rumble Ball with the thought to protect his friends. As a consequence, Chopper transforms into an oversized and purely instinct-driven version of himself that Kureha had best described as a monster.</summary>

Blackbeard then overwhelms Ace, making him another offer to join his crew. But Ace refuses and the two use their strongest attacks on each other.

He also explains the two changes that happened in the new world after two years which is Akainu becoming fleet admiral and Marshall D. Teach taking all of Whitebeard's territories and claiming the title of "Yonko" among Shanks, Charlotte Linlin and Kaido. Jimbei also claims that Blackbeard is searching for the strongest Devil Fruits so he can extract their abilities and claim them for his own use, with Chopper fearing that he'll be targeted next and Usopp saying that Blackbeard wouldn't want his Human-Human fruit ability. Luffy doesn't listen to Jimbei's blabbing and Luffy sees Keimi and asks where Shirahoshi is and she says that she is in her room. Luffy senses a "big animal" in the palace so he calls Zoro and Sanji to come with him and they find Caribou using his Logia powers to capture Shirahoshi. Luffy kicks him out and Minister of the Right thanks him once again. Minister of the Right wonders why the tower has been cut into pieces and Pappug says that Zoro did it and Zoro gets mad. After hearing Minister of the Right say that Caribou had stolen all the treasure from the vault and that Neptune would give it all to them, Nami reprimands Luffy, Zoro, and Sanji for not tying Caribou up and angrily kicks them out to find him and get the treasure back. Meanwhile in Hordy's cell, Hordy and his crew appear to be aged by the energy steroids that they used, which was later revealed to be aging pills, and still sought vengeance against the royal family, the Straw Hats, and humans. As everyone leaves Hordy's cell, Hordy yells at Fukaboshi for "betraying his kind." Fukaboshi answers by saying that he won't hold vengeance on Hordy for killing his mother and orders him to shut up so the children won't here him and be tainted by his evil. Soon, the Minister of the Left gets news that Baron Tamago and Pekoms, crew members of the Big Mom Pirates, are in Fishman Island going to receive the monthly payment of sweets. With the candy factory destroyed and all the excess candy given to the Straw Hats to eat at the banquet, the Fishman Island can't pay their monthly payment. The Minister of the Left then states that Big Mom destroys islands that do not give her candy.</summary>

    <summary>During a check on the palace, the Minister of the Right gets a report that the Tamate Box is gone along with all the treasures and remembers something very important about it. Caribou starts searching for his treasure that he stole from the royal family after realizing it was taken after waking up from getting beat by Luffy. Jimbei and Neptune talk about how Jimbei might join the Straw Hats and putting a new pirate flag in Fishman Island which is the Straw Hat Pirate flag. Later, the Minister of the Right tells King Neptune that the Tamate Box is gone and it might explode in the hands of Luffy if he opens it. However, when Luffy returns, he announces that he gave all the treasure that he recovered to Pekoms and Baron Tamago, along with the tamate box, and tells everyone that he talked back to Big Mom. While Neptune and the Minister of the Right worry about the fate of the Straw Hats, and Nami beats Luffy up for giving away the treasure, Jimbei decides to cut off the alliance with Big Mom before things get ugly. Caribou finds Tamago and Pekoms with his treasure that he stole and attacks Pekoms with his Gatling Gun. Pekoms reveals himself to be a Zoan-type Devil Fruit user. Caribou then attempts to slice off Pekom's head, saying that he was stronger because he was a logia-type devil fruit eater, only to get punched in the stomach by Pekoms, rendering him unconscious again. Pekoms and Tamago then leave Fishman island. It is later revealed that Smoker and Tashigi were reassigned to the G-5 Marine Branch, the most ruthless marine branch that don't even take orders from the HQ, and arrested a bunch of pirates emerging from Fishman Island, who tell Smoker that Luffy beat Hordy, with Smoker replying that he already knows and calls them idiots.</summary>

    <summary>The mermaids and Keimi from the Mermaid Cafe ask Sharley if they can say farewell to the Straw Hats. Sharley says that her prediction that Luffy will destroy Fishman Island might not happen after all since they defeated Hordy and the New Fishman Pirates. However, Keimi fears that Madam Sharley still believes that Luffy will destroy the Fishman Island because she knows that her predictions are always right. Shirahoshi meanwhile is crying and asking the Straw Hats to not go. While Minister of the Right talks to Neptune about mentioning the exploding tamate box to the Straw Hats, Neptune points out that Usopp, Brook, and Chopper complain that they are going to die in the New World and that they shouldn't tell them more bad news, later having optimistic ideas about how Big Mom might not open it herself or that the explosives might not explode. The Minister of the Left gives Nami a new Log Pose with three needles so they can get to the islands in the New World. He explains that the new log pose takes in the magnetic waves of 3 surrounding islands and that the needle that moves the most is the direction of the most dangerous island. After hearing that, Nami, Chopper, and Usopp tell the Minister of the left to keep it down so Luffy doesn't hear, which he evidently does. He then grabs onto Nami wanting to see the new Log Pose and says to go in the direction of the needle that moves the most, stating, "that's where the party is". Nami insists that she will tell the crew where to go. However, Luffy states that he should decide where they should go, as he is the captain. Franky gets a new haircut and they start to leave but Shirahoshi comes and ask them to pinky promise to come back and they did. The Straw Hats and the fishmen go their separate ways and Luffy remembers the times when Shanks, Rayleigh, Jimbei, and Ace told him something important. The Straw Hats then comment about what they will do once they are in the New World.</summary>

Nami asks Chopper if he wants to join her in the bath and he says no claiming that he took one two days ago and the cloud reminds him of cotton candy. Sanji and Brook walk by and saw Nami taking a bath so they stare at her. Nami asked Chopper to move aside away from the cloud she made and the cloud electrified Sanji and Brook. Chopper claims he is scared and he won't eat the cloud. Meanwhile Luffy, Zoro, Usopp, Franky and Robin are hanging out.

Meanwhile, Sanji and Franky beat up all the hazmat suit guys and Sanji wants to kill the samurai because he taunts his merciful behaviour. They then try to catch up with the children, Nami and Chopper. Brownbeard and the centaurs attempt to kill Luffy, Zoro, Usopp and Robin but Zoro cuts their cannons while Luffy deflects the rest. Brownbeard tells the centaurs to aim for the water to sink the straw hats but they paddle to safety. Brook runs away from the samurai's torso and sees it get caught in a big snowball, which starts to roll downhill towards the lake.

    <summary>Luffy, Zoro, Usopp and Robin try to get to the frozen side of Punk Hazard, but their ship gets capsized by Brownbeard. As Brownbeard's troops prepare to attack them again, Zoro gets ready to destroy their bullets, but gets dragged down by sharks. At the last second, Brook saves Zoro and defeats Brownbeard's shooters. Once Luffy and the gang get out of the freezing water after killing the sharks, they opt to take the centaur's warm coats. Having realized that the Straw Hats are fighting them, Brownbeard orders an immediate retreat, only to be stopped by Luffy, Zoro, and Robin. Meanwhile, the other Straw Hats attempt to go back into the building to find another escape route, but their "hearts" get switched by Law making them swap bodies: Franky in Chopper's, Chopper in Sanji's, Nami in Franky's and Sanji in Nami's, with Sanji overjoyed to have big breasts. Law then returns his attention to the marines and destroys their ship. The G-5 marines attempt to contact marine headquarters about Law, but he takes away all their Transponder Snails. Smoker then fights Law and warns his men to stay back from the fight to not get cut to pieces (which they do) by Law's Op-Op Fruit powers. Feeling useless in the situation, Tashigi attempts to strike the Warlord but is promptly bisected.</summary>

    <summary>Feeling dishonoured by still being alive, Tashigi tells Law to kill her but he says she doesn't have the right to tell him when or how she can die, and she tries to attack him with her broken sword. She misses and Law prepares to slice her again before Smoker steps in and fights Law. Meanwhile, the beaten centaurs talk about how they underestimated the Straw Hats, who took Brownbeard with them. While they contemplate on that, Luffy's group ride Brownbeard to the mysterious building that Brook saw. In the lab, a hazmat guy tells the mysterious smoke man that Law and Smoker are in a fight, the children escaped with Nami's group, and that Smoker saw the children. The smoke man becomes angry but says that if he tries to kill Smoker, the navy would get suspicious. Just then, the Harpy that Usopp saw, Monet, informs the smoke man that they captured Straw Hats pirates and that Luffy's group beat Vegapunk's dragon and the centaurs and are on their way to the facility. The smoke man finally decides to kill the Straw Hats and G-5, although he knows the navy could be alerted. He then tells Monet to call Joker. Back with Sanji's group, the children begin to realize that Nami, Sanji, Chopper, and Franky switched bodies. They also start to get cold. Sanji states that he doesn't care about anyone anymore and asks if someone has a camera so he can take a picture of himself in Nami's body. When a child falls and complains that it's cold, Franky begins to say that it was a bad idea to bring the kids if they didn't have a plan. Back at the main entrance to the facility, Smoker and Law are still fighting as the G-5 are watching and putting themselves back together outside Law's bubble. As the fighting continues, the G-5 try to figure out why Law is fighting them even though he's a warlord. Tashigi tries to fight but the G-5 stop her. She then reflects on what Smoker told her two years ago: "Pirates will be pirates." Closing in on the fight, Law's recoils cut up everything in the way. Smoker then begins to ask him why he was on the island, with Law saying nothing. Back to Tashigi, she begins to remember what Smoker said after the incident at Enies lobby. She remembers him saying that they have to be promoted and that he would kick the asses of the Straw Hats in the New World. In the fight, Smoker tells Law that he never trusted the Warlords and as Smoker charges at him, Law says under his breath, "Maybe that's the right thing to do," and begins to make stone spikes rise from the ground in Smoker's direction to get him. Although Smoker dodges most of them, Law rises one from under him and Smoker gets jabbed. As he drops his jitte, Smoker once again asks why Law is on the island and the two begin to fight again. Law finally answers the question by asking why the G-5 are here. Law pushes Smoker back and Smoker tries to jab Law but instead breaks through a stone spike that Law rose from the ground. As he ducks from the attack, Law tell Smoker that from his current standing he couldn't see a few things and poked out his heart. Law takes the heart and his sword and says that he doesn't have to say anything to Smoker. With his heart outside of his body, Smoker collapses.</summary>

    <summary>Celebrating Mr. Satan's victory at the IGO tournament, the group discovers that the tournament was planned with the ulterior motive of gathering the world's strongest fighters to capture the legendary Deep Sea Glutton creature Akami, which has the ability to suck the energy out of living things. The Akami appears and attacks Mr. Satan, Usopp and Gohan, poisoning them and absorbing their energy, before disappearing again; This leaves the group with only 30 minutes to find Akami and create an antidote to its poison. After defeating Sanji, Piccolo, Franky, Gotenks and others, Akami evolves into an even more powerful monster, even gaining the ability to absorb and use the power of energy attacks intended to stop it. Luffy and Toriko distract the monster while Goku charges a Spirit Bomb using the energy from everyone at the tournament. This attack, along with a simultaneous finishing move from all three combatants, defeats Akami, and the group resumes their banquet. Neither Zoro, Zebra or Vegeta participate, as they have been fighting each other since the tournament began.

Meanwhile, the children were returned to the Lab where Caesar ordered his subordinates to make sure they didn't escape again. However, Mocha begins to regain her senses, seeing Caesar's subordinates as monsters. Within Caesar's private quarters, Vergo and Monet are waiting for Caesar's return. As soon as he arrived, he revealed that he made a deal with Law in the past to give his heart to him, and in exchange, he would get to keep Monet's. He shows Law that Vergo is now in possession of his heart while he himself has Smoker's heart, but before he tortures him, Monet informs Caesar that the broadcast is ready. In the broadcast, it is shown that a very large candy is being offered to Smiley, which is a deadly weaponized gas known as Shinokuni (The Land of the Dead). Caesar then ordered the men who brought the candy to quickly return to the Lab. As Zoro's Group is being chased by Smiley, the poison beast sees the candy and promptly swallows it, ignoring the false heartfelt words from Caesar. He then laughs as everyone watching the broadcast sees the creature behaving strangely.</summary>

    <summary>After Smiley swallows the over-sized candy, the candy coat dissolves revealing a special drug designed to convert the entire content of Smiley's body into a "perfect" weapon of destruction, Shinokuni. In the process, Smiley dies and in a sack of apples, an apple turns into a Devil Fruit. The beast's body transforms into poison gas spreading quickly throughout the island. Its lethal power was demonstrated when Caesar's men were caught in it, being petrified before the eyes of the Brokers and the captive Straw Hats. Zoro's team are seen desperately trying to outrun the approaching gas while Nami and Usopp help Brownbeard after their vicious attack by Caesar. At the Lab, Caesar reveals to his captives that they will get to experience the poison gas as well, moving them outside dangling in a cave. In spite of their situation, Law told Luffy that their original plan will still carry on and that it is time to strike back at Caesar.</summary>

    <summary>As the Underworld Brokers watched the video feed of the captive Straw Hats and Marines, Eustass Kid and Killer decided to ignore it for more important matters, such as forming an alliance between the Kid Pirates, On Air Pirates and the Hawkins Pirates. Law then decided to set his plan into motion and orders Franky to blow a fireball at a destroyed ship, creating enough smoke to block the cage from being seen from outside. Law then breaks free, explaining that he switched the sea prism stones with fakes during his stay on the island, and proceeds to free the others and restoring Tashigi and Smoker in their own bodies while securing their aid. Franky however had to leave them and protect the Thousand Sunny. Meanwhile, Zoro and Nami's group are still running away from Shinokuni, and they manage to join up while escaping. Luffy's group managed to enter the lab with the aid of Law, and they opened the gate, allowing the G-5 Marines to get in before closing the gate, but the rest of the Straw Hats were still outside. Seeing their only chance of hope closing, Zoro and Kin'emon effortlessly cut the gate open, getting everyone inside safely.</summary>

    <summary>Though the Straw Hats and Brownbeard managed to escape into the lab, they left behind a gaping hole. But they soon realise that Shinokuni can now enter the lab. The G-5 Marines panickingly seals the hole back up with various wooden and metal planks. They succeeded in sealing the hole as Shinokuni proceeds to spread throughout the island. Brook uses the power of his Devil Fruit to become a soul and survey the area outside of the lab, noting that 'it was like the land of the dead'. After regaining their senses, the G-5 marines then turn their guns and swords towards the Straw Hats preparing to arrest them. Nami notices Law and demands him to switch back her and Sanji's body, to which Sanji secretly refuses. Law agrees to return them to their original bodies and uses Shambles to switch their hearts back. Nami notices that she was wearing a different coat and punches Sanji, accusing him of peeping at her body. Law then explains to everyone present that they only have two hours to escape, he then continues by saying the only passage that leads safely leads out of the island is called R-66 and is found in Room R. The marines were reluctant, but quickly changes their mind when Smoker repeated the order to them. Smoker then orders Tashigi to take command of the men and rescue the children as he goes to confront Vergo. Meanwhile, Caesar Clown is celebrating the deaths of his victims but notices that the cage has no solidified bodies, which he needed to prove the power of Shinokuni. He also notices the absence of the G-5 Marines. Vergo states that Luffy and the others must have broken out of the cage and helped the G-5 soldiers' escape. Before Luffy went to fight Caesar again, Zoro calls out to Luffy reminding him that this is just the beginning of the New World and he mustn't let his guard down again, and Luffy happily complies as he plows through the Satyr soldiers. Caesar Clown then receives the news that the Straw Hats and Marines have broken into the Lab, leaving him alarmed and flabbergasted at their escape.</summary>

The marines cheered as their beloved Vice Admiral Vergo shows up but that turned to horror when he brutally assaulted them. Tashigi tries to defend them from him but was viciously struck down. That action was enough to cause Sanji to come to the rescue, claiming he heard her tears falling. The Straw Hats (minus Sanji) and Brownbeard were still heading towards the end of the passage until the small dragon shows up and begins to attack them while Brownbeard suggests that he keeps running. Chopper manages to run into Mocha who was still hallucinating and manages to defeat the soldiers trying to apprehend her and give her a sedative to calm her down.

The bribed fighters protecting Elizabello II guard themselves from Blue Gilly's assault but were backstabbed by Dagama who revealed that Blue Gilly was his partner, but Dagama secretly plans to betray Blue Gilly. However, the long-legged martial artist never trusted the tactical schemer and quickly knocks him out of the ring. Bellamy is currently struggling against Bartolomeo while at the same time, Elizabello II is cornered but is fully prepared to unleash his devastating punch. The audience heard of the fighting king's reputation and proceeds to get out of the way of his punch. When Blue Gilly moves in for the kill, the king delivers the punch at point blank, creating a destructive shockwave throughout the ring. When the smoke cleared, Elizabello II and Bartolomeo were the only ones standing with the latter revealing his Bari-Bari Fruit which allows him to create barriers by crossing his fingers and the former being defeated by that power. Bartolomeo is now the champion of the Block B battle royale. Meanwhile, Franky is informed by Thunder Soldier that he too is part of an operation to destroy the SMILE factory but needs the cyborg's help in rescuing the workers held prisoner there.

Many of the fighters in the holding cell show their respect to the former king, and Doflamingo's role as an agitator and arms dealer in inter-kingdom conflict is discussed.

Ten years ago Doflamingo appeared in the king's chambers, asking for a 10 billion Beli ransom, in order to leave the country alone. Riku sent his soldiers to ask of the citizens' money, but while they were willingly trying to help their king, Doflamingo controlled Riku and his soldiers with his ability, and made them attack their own people against their will. In the shadows, Doflamingo and his crew are waiting for the right moment to interfere and act as a saving hero in the eyes of Dressrosa's confused citizens.</summary>

    <summary>While Doflamingo continues to control Riku Dold III, his subordinates manage to take control of the castle with the help of Monet, who was at the time undercover as a servant and also took princess Viola hostage. With the people's trust in him in tatters, and his spirit broken, King Riku begs for death. Then, Doflamingo appears with his strongest subordinates and defeats the king and his army, setting the grounds for his takeover of the island. After telling the Straw Hat Pirates of the tragedies of the past, Thunder Soldier explains that the king is still alive since Viola pledged her service to Doflamingo in exchange for the King's life. He, also, explained that although the toys of Dressrosa were once people who despised Doflamingo, they still remember who they were, but not each other and that the drive for revolution is still in them. Thunder Soldier also explains that the reason for their rebellion was the news of Doflamingo resignation was false, shocking Usopp, Robin and Franky, who realize they unintentionally caused the rebellion. In the underground chamber, almost all of the fighters were transformed except for Riku and Chinjao, with the latter having mysteriously forgotten that he had grandchildren. In the colosseum, Luffy meets up with Zoro and Kin'emon with the help of Bartolomeo, although he was nowhere to be seen.</summary>

Speculations of Rebecca cheating were thrown throughout the crowd, but Rebecca was the only one who saw what really happened. During the fight, Rebecca saw Cavendish fall asleep in the middle of the battle. Before the other fighters would capitalize on their sleeping target, Cavendish promptly woke up with a sinister face that promised torment for his enemies. In that instant, Cavendish moved like the wind, cutting down every fighter in his way. Rebecca however saw this and barely manages to avoid a fatal strike from Cavendish, who then fell asleep again. Outside, Vice Admiral Bastille finished explaining to an officer about what happened in the colosseum as this was the work of not Cavendish, but his alter ego Hakuba, a dangerous man who eluded the marines years ago for his dangerous technique. At the Palace, Doflamingo is standing before King Riku who is chained up. Doflamingo gloated that Viola's hope of the Straw Hats defeating him and freeing Law is worthless, as he had full confidence that his men will prevent them from breaching his operations and believes that Luffy is still trapped in the colosseum. At that moment, Robin and Usopp have successfully infiltrated the basement harbor, and Luffy's group ran into Viola who wants to help them in entering the palace.</summary>

    <summary>While Usopp faces Trebol, the Thunder Soldier recalls his time as Kyros. He was arrested after killing some thugs who murdered his best friend. After much time as a gladiator, Kyros chooses to stay even after winning his freedom, due to the citizens' hatred of him and the traumatic guilt of his act of murder, until his 3000th fight against a disguised King Riku who convinces him to be free. Kyros manages to become King Riku's captain of his guard despite objections from the latter eldest daughter Scarlett, who at first isn't fond of Kryos but falls in love with him after he saves her from pirates. Kyros and Scarlett later marry after her family helps her fake her death (as to avoid a scandal of a princess marrying a former criminal) and together conceive Rebecca. As they have a happy life together as a family, Doflamingo ruins it as he attempts to take over Dressrosa that night 10 years ago.</summary>

    <summary>At dinner, Doflamingo discusses their next target who has been allying with other groups as Law walks in. Machvise points out a white patch on Law's chest and Giolla recognizes it as Amber Lead Syndrome, but Doflamingo angrily tells her not to spread rumors, explaining how it's caused by poisoning. When asked how he escaped Flevance, Law reveals that he hid under a mountain of corpses. Doflamingo asks Law who he holds a grudge against, prompting Law to claim he wants to destroy everything and telling Corazon that he will get his revenge at any cost. The next day, the Donquixote Pirates executives attack a pirate hideout and take their treasure. Baby 5 asks what Flevance was like and learn how it is a white city caused by the Amber Lead and used to create different types of goods. But, it would poison and erode the body if dug up and handled, something the World Government and Flevance royalty kept secret because of the fortune it would bring. It also consequentially shortens the lifespan by about 20 more years each generation, effectively killing the kids before adulthood. People eventually began to collapse at the same time due to the buildup of Amber Lead in their bodies and began to die with immense pain flooding their bodies. Surrounding countries placed a quarantine on Flevance because they thought it was contagious and the royalty escaped with the help of the World Government. However, Flevance wouldn't remain quiet as war broke out with neighboring countries showing no mercy. In the past, Flevance citizens were killed as soldiers gun down anyone they find. A nun tries to get Law to come with her and the other children after some soldiers promised to let them escape, but Law stays because his sister is dying. The nun promises to come back on the next ship to get Law and tells him that there is always hope and that a loving hand will one day reach out to him. Law's father tries to get help from other doctors but none will come, afraid of becoming infected. Elsewhere, Law stands next to his sister, Lami, who tells him that her body hurts and is turning more white every day. Law holds her hand and promises that their father will find a cure because he is the greatest doctor in the country. As soldiers gun down civilians outside, Lami asks Law why it is so noisy, prompting Law to lie about there being a festival going on because Flevance is always prosperous. Soldiers enter the hospital to kill anybody they find and Law hides Lami in a closet, but finds his parents killed and screams in grief. Law leaps through a window as the soldiers fire at him and runs away in tears as they pursue him. He hides under a bridge and finds the children and nun lying dead, causing him to fall into tears while remembering the nun's words about hope. He returns to the hospital but finds it burning and suffers a complete mental breakdown screaming Lami's name. In the present, Senor Pink reveals that Flevance perished as the Donquixote Pirates finish off the pirates and notes that any 10-year-old who experienced that would have their personality screwed up. Law walks through the garbage dump and sees Corazon reading a newspaper. Law notes that his family and everyone from Flevance died while Corazon lived claiming it's not fair. Holding a dagger, Law lunges toward Corazon and stabs in the back but gets caught by Buffalo who exclaims that he must inform Doflamingo.</summary>

    <summary>As Doflamingo sleeps, he starts dreaming about his past when people talk about how they should kill the Donquixote Family because they are former World Nobles who will not be saved by the Marines, Doflamingo begins to sweat and grind his teeth in agitation. In the past, Doflamingo, Rosinante, and Homing were hung from the windows of their burning house by ropes around their arms and blindfolded. A mob of commoners desired revenge for the suffering the Celestial Dragons had inflicted on them and debated how they should kill them, but keep them alive so they could suffer. The citizens recount the sufferings caused by the World Nobles, who had hurt them, their relatives, and their countries whenever they felt like it. Doflamingo screams in terror as a man demanded to know if they ever felt any kind of pain before waking up in a cold sweat as the Transponder Snail rings. After putting on his sunglasses and drinking alcohol, Doflamingo picks it up and is informed that Law did something. Seventeen years ago in Mariejois, several World Nobles expressed their shock at Homing and his family giving up their status to become normal humans. This prompted Homing to claim they had been human ever since they was born, offending the World Nobles. Soon after, they were taking to a non-member island in the North Blue with a house and assets prepared for them. Homing then handed over his family's World Noble identification chips and told his family that they would lead a humble life there. But, after Homing revealed that they moved from Mariejois, the people burned their house downed searching for them. The Donquixote Family watched in terror from the forest nearby and ran through a rainy forest to a run-down shack in a garbage dump where they took shelter. Then, they found shelter in a small village, and Homing contacted the World Nobles for help, however they refused and told him to never call again. Soon after, Doflamingo and Rosinante were caught stealing bread and were beat up as punishment and ate from a garbage pile before bringing their mother some food, only to find her sick. Eventually, she dies leaving Rosinante crying as Doflamingo blamed Homing for her death. the angry mob then finds them and Homing begs them to pardon his sons as Doflamingo cursed his father for bringing them to ruin. In the present, Giolla and Machvise bring Law to Doflamingo as Giolla reveals that they found him trying to escape. As Buffalo and Baby 5 watch, with Buffalo noting that they will torture Law for stabbing Corazon, Law notices Corazon is present and wonders if he will die. However, Doflamingo reveals that he called Law to welcome him to the Donquixote Pirates. Doflamingo explains how Law has a certain quality in his eyes after experiencing such a horrible past, while Law wonders why Corazon has not yet told Doflamingo what happened. When Law points out that he is going to die in three years regardless, but Doflamingo claims that this depends on his luck before explaining how they specialize the black market and handle Devil Fruits, which means there could be a fruit that can cure him. Doflamingo states that he will train Law to become his right-hand man in ten years. Corazon begins coughing and reveals the wound on his abdomen, prompting Doflamingo to ask what happened. However, Corazon communicates that an enemy caused it and he finished him off, prompting Doflamingo to tell him to get his wound treated as a shocked Law wonders if Corazon covered up for him. Later, Doflamingo informs his crew that they will be moving their base toward Reverse Mountain while expanding their business. As they were moving across the sea, they engaged in combat with the Marines and pulled bank heists. At one point, Law and Baby 5 were attacked by a pirate named Wellington, but were saved by Doflamingo and his executives. Law began studying under Doflamingo, training with firearms under Gladius, learning martial arts with Lao G, and practicing swordsmanship with Diamante. Two years later, Baby 5 and Buffalo tell Law their real names, but he initially refuses to tell them his. However, Buffalo claims that he will tell Doflamingo of Law stabbing Corazon two years ago if he does not reveal his true name, prompting Law to reveal his full name is Trafalgar D. Water Law, which alerts Corazon. Law admits that he should not be telling them this because his family has kept the initial D. a secret for many generations, and is irritated when Baby 5 and Buffalo complain about it not being interesting. However, Law is suddenly grabbed by the collar and hauled away by Corazon. After being thrown into an alley, Corazon asks Law if what he said before is true. A surprised Law finds out Corazon can speak and Corazon tells him to get away because he should not be around Doflamingo with the initial D. in his name.</summary>

    <summary>Luffy and Bellamy continue their confrontation. Meanwhile, Baby 5 mistakes Sai's words as a proposal, while Chinjao struggles against Lao G's Geo-Fist techniques. Hearing Sai's and Baby 5's conversation Chinjao, also misunderstanding, reminds Sai he's arranged to be married to the daughter of the Niho Navy's leader to form an alliance. When Baby 5 asks Sai how to be of use to him he jokingly tells her to die, which she responds by happily preparing to commit suicide. In a flashback, it's revealed that as a young child, Baby 5 was abandoned by her mother who called her useless and unwanted, which is why she is willing to do whatever's asked of her as a way to feel needed. Not wanting to win this way, Sai tries to stop her, but Chinjao attacks him for trying to help an enemy. Sai counters resulting in Chinjao's head drill getting bent, before slapping Baby 5 and telling her to value her life more. Chinjao awakens and instead of being angry, is proud of Sai for surpassing him and officially dubs him the head of the Happo Navy, promises to break off Sai's engagement and bestows his technique on Sai's leg, before being struck down by Lao G, who had used a technique to restore his body to its prime. In retaliation, Sai challenges Lao G. Sai declares to take Baby 5 as his wife before defeating Lao G with his grandfather's "Drill Dragon Nail" technique.</summary>

    <summary>As some of the Donquixote Pirates' underlings exclaim that Lao G has been defeated, Zoro looks over the enormous rift in the ground created by Sai before deciding to keep Sai and his fleet in mind due to how powerful they are. Meanwhile, Sai runs up to the battered Chinjao and begs him to not die as Baby 5 states that she will make preparations for two ceremonies, a wedding and a funeral, which prompts both Sai and Chinajo to angrily proclaim that the latter is not dead yet. Above them, Zoro continues dodging Pica's stone spikes as Pica laughs at him. When an irritated Zoro tells him to stop laughing because it is annoying, Pica becomes angered and uses Charlestone once more, which sends several of his subordinates flying. Managing to dodge the spikes, Zoro runs along one of them and cuts Pica's stone face to pieces, only for Pica to escape. Elizabello II offers to assist Zoro, but Zoro states that he will be the one to defeat him before telling Elizabello to save his King Punch. Meanwhile, on Flower Hill, the ground flaps up and down like a flag, causing Kyros to lose his balance and forced to lean on his sword for support. Realizing that the toy soldier who was crying and screaming when he killed Scarlet was actually Kyros, Diamante notes that there is nothing but hatred between them. Kyros agrees and leaps into the air before proclaiming that this is why he came here as he attacks Diamante, who blocks with his steel cape before attacking Rebecca. However, Kyros manages to block the attack, prompting Diamante to run toward him and seemingly attack him only to redirect the attack toward Rebecca at the last second. After Kyros blocks this attack as well, Rebecca realizes that Diamante is targeting her and tells Kyros she will fight as well, prompting Diamante to proclaim he will kill her as well before attacking her once more. As Kyros protects Rebecca again, Diamante states that he wants to see him lose both his wife and daughter as Kyros tells Rebecca he will fight because he wants to avenge Scarlett and compensate for teaching her how to fight before proclaiming that he will no longer let his daughter swing a sword now that he is human once more. Elsewhere in Dressrosa, Sabo saves a mother and her daughter from a burning building as parts of the flaming ceiling fall down around them. After getting the mother and daughter outside, Sabo offers them cups of water before hearing a soldier shouting that his friends are stuck in a cage at the colosseum. When Sabo tells him to take him there, the soldier agrees and runs off, leaving Sabo to look up at the palace where Luffy is fighting before running after him. Luffy continues to fight Bellamy, whom he unsuccessfully tries to convince to stop attacking him and pushing himself closer to death. Meanwhile, Doflamingo and Trebol defeat Law while Gladius inflates the ground to create a large explosion to kill Cavendish, who furiously demands Bartolomeo to let him into his barrier.</summary>

Doflamingo laughs at this new form, but Luffy retracts his fist into his arm and punches him, blowing him into the city far below. Luffy follows using elastic foce from his legs to fly and lands more large blows on Doflamingo as the Warlord struggles to keep on even footing. However, Luffy is able to absorb Doflamingo's attacks due to his body being rubbery despite being armored and continuously stretching his arms while also changing the direction of his punches.</summary>

Doflamingo then attacks Rebecca, but she's teleported away by Law. As their battle resumes, Doflamingo relentlessly attacks Luffy with string and takes control of him. Luffy starts to remember that during his training with Rayleigh, he fought an opponent too big for the Kong Gun to work on,  and Rayleigh told him that he needed to come up with something else. Luffy realizes that his Kong Gun isn't enough to beat Doflamingo. Doflamingo tells Luffy that they should have all just stayed in his cage and submitted to his manipulation, saying that humans should only live when a divine being like him manipulates them. He says that he would not have had to carry out this massacre if they had not cut their puppet strings, but Luffy has had enough with his talk. Luffy breaks free by activating Fourth Gear and flies into the air, where he declares his disgust to Doflamingo on how he manipulates everyone and makes it feel like he's suffocating, and the Warlord says that the people here were born as trash and are meant to be manipulated. Luffy tells him to be quiet as he retracts his forearm, and Doflamingo creates a web to protect himself. Luffy then blows air into his other arm, making the retracted arm even bigger, as he remembers sharing his idea for an improved Kong Gun with Rayleigh, as he prepares to deliver the final blow. Doflamingo creates sixteen string spears imbued with Armament Haki for a final attack of his own. Doflamingo uses his God Thread technique and Luffy unleashes his Gum-Gum King Kong Gun. The clash between Luffy and the strings is powerful enough to cause ripples in the water and be felt by the citizens below, and everyone on Dressrosa cheers Luffy on as he breaks through Doflamingo's attack and defense before hitting Doflamingo himself. The force of the punch sends Doflamingo flying into the ground, with the impact tearing apart the city, and Doflamingo falls down into the underground harbor. Law looks up at Luffy and remembers how Corazon once told him in some countries, there are people who call those with the name of "D.", the sworn enemy of the gods as Doflamingo's shattered glasses fall away and Luffy hovers in the air victorious.</summary>

He didn't want the Navy to appear to be heroes as they were the ones who allowed Doflamingo to do what he pleased in the first place and that he left the Straw Hats to do everything in hopes that they would succeed. Knowing the Navy may want to save face Riku orders Tank to take the Straw Hat and their allies as well as any homeless civilians to the palace.

Fujitora states that he does not want to be made into a hero for something he did not do, and that the World Government needs to take responsibility for their actions. Sakazuki shouts that it is a matter of credibility and trust, but Fujitora responds that if such meaningless trust is important, it would be better not to have any. Sakazuki tells Fujitora that he can never set foot in a Marine base until he captures Luffy and Law, which Fujitora agrees to.</summary>

As Fujitora prepares to crush them with his floating rubble, he begins reflecting, knowing that the Straw Hats and their allies will soon perish. However, even if they somehow managed to escape, they would be targeted by the Four Emperors. Fujitora notes Luffy's sympathy for his blindness, but reveals that he blinded himself because he had seen many things he did not want to. Suddenly, the citizens of Dressrosa chase after the criminals with the apparent intention of taking down the Straw Hats themselves due to Luffy kidnapping Rebecca. As the citizens run past Fujitora, he hears one of them ask why they are doing this, as Rebecca was really with Kyros as they always knew about Kyros' and Scarlett's marriage. Another citizen replies that they knew this, as well as who the fairies really were. As such, the citizens are only putting on a facade, shouting threats with smiles on their faces and stopping at the edge of the coast to cheer on the Straw Hats. Fujitora reflects that everyone really does want to help Luffy and begins wondering what Luffy looks like, as he regrets blinding himself. The Straw Hats are awestruck when they reach the enormous flagship Yonta Maria, and Bartolomeo promises to show them his ship later. Hajrudin reveals that he and four other giants are going to reform the Giant Warrior Pirates, and Orlumbus says that his fleet of 56 ships should also help them, which confused the Straw Hats.

    <summary>Somewhere at sea, a group of pirates form an alliance to take revenge on Luffy for taking down Doflamingo's market, which they had relied on. They also plan to ransack Dressrosa if Riku has become king again. Luffy initially refuses his allies' request to serve under him, tell them that he does not want control over them because it would not let him sail freely and become Pirate King like he wanted to.

Suddenly, they come under attack by the pirate alliance, but Fujitora destroys the alliance by dropping his rubble on their ships, saying its a parting gift for Luffy.

However, Law leaves and tells her to leave him alone. Rob Lucci and Spandam, now CP-0 agents, search Dressrosa for weapons, but find none. The people of Dressrosa celebrate a new era in their history, as the existence of the dwarves is revealed to the humans and they begin fully coexisting, and Leo has the humans build statues of Luffy, Kyros, and Usopp, as Riku Doldo III prepares for Reverie. Out at sea, an imprisoned Doflamingo wonders who will gain power over the entire world. Meanwhile, the pirate Jack prepares to attack the Marine convoy transporting Doflamingo. Elsewhere, the Straw Hats are shocked to see Bartolomeo's ship, the Going Luffy-senpai. The entire ship pays homage to the Straw Hats, as the masthead is a giant Luffy statue, a wall in the middle is a large replica of the Going Merry's head, there is a giant Chopper figurehead in the stern, and they also have tangerine groves like Nami's. Franky compliments the design, and everyone in the Barto Club is dazzled to hear this. Bartolomeo points to their most important edition, the newly acquired vivre card that Sabo gave to Luffy. Back on the Yonta Maria some time ago, Luffy had given pieces of the vivre card to Bellamy, who decided to go on his own path, as well as all the Grand Fleet crews as they departed. As the group starts hearing to Zou, Bartolomeo shows them their updated bounties and wanted posters, although notably Sanji is wanted only alive.

The pirate Luffy is sailing in a search of "Piece-mains", pirates that focus on adventure and attack the "Morganeer" pirates who plunder lawlessly, when a Ruku ("monster bird") named Balloon lands in his ship. Luffy hands Balloon over to the nearby sorcerer pirate Speil, but gets imprisoned on Spiel's ship after insulting him. Luffy is trapped with Anne, a close friend of Balloon who explains that Spiel is after his magic blood and has kidnapped her as bait. Luffy in turn mentions that he was inspired by his pirate grandfather, and as a child unknowingly ate the Gum-Gum Devil Fruit belonging to him. Luffy uses his rubber powers to break them both out but is uninteresting in saving Balloon. Spiel shoots Anne after discovering her unlocking Balloon's cage and attacks Luffy when insulted again. Losing the fight and having obtained the Ruku he was after, Spiel destroys his ship with his former crew still aboard and uses Balloon to escape. After Anne saves him from drowning, Luffy successfully fights Spiel and rescues Balloon.</summary>
